# Malaysian Dessert Classifier - Project Overview
I built a web app with dessert classifier to identify Malaysian desserts. This could be useful for tourists unfamiliar with Malaysian food. They could take a picture of a dessert and the app serve them some information about the ingredients (to check for food allergens), calories and whether the dessert is sweet or savoury.
