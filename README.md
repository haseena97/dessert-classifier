# Malaysian Dessert Classifier - Project Overview
I built a simple web app with dessert classifier to identify the name of Malaysian desserts. This could be useful for tourists unfamiliar with Malaysian food. They could take a picture of a dessert and the app serve them some information about the ingredients (to check for food allergens), calories and whether the dessert is sweet or savoury.

I deployed the model on [HuggingFace Spaces with Gradio](https://huggingface.co/spaces/haseena97/malaysian_dessert):

I was able to get the model to predict the name of the dessert with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34.

## Data
I used [FatKun Batch Download Image](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf) chrome extension to download the data from google images as recommended in the tutorial.

## Step 1: Build image classifier
## Step 2: Build Gradio interface
